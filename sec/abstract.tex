\section*{Abstract}

Deep learning has become the most actively researched area in machine learning,
pushing state-of-the-art performance on tasks like image and speech recognition
or machine translation.
This thesis applies deep learning methods to tweet engagement prediction, i.e.,
estimating the eventual popularity of any given tweet.
Several deep neural network architectures are developed for multi-class classification
and regression tasks, using both structured and unstructured input data.
The models are evaluated on several data sets, comprising tweets from public
figures like athletes and politicians, as well as companies.
Conducted experiments show that even simple feedforward networks outperform
linear baseline models considerably, while solely relying on easily extractable
structured features.
Adding raw tweet content to a more sophisticated multi-input neural network
further enhances performance, although these increases can only
be established for data sets containing at least 200,000 training examples.
An emphasis is put on developing production-ready models, i.e., networks
capable of making near real-time predictions without requiring additional data
such as the author's tweet history.
