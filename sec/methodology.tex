\section{Methodology}
\label{ch:methodology}

Having established necessary background knowledge in the previous chapter,
the experiments of this work can be introduced.
This chapter will first examine prior work in the area of tweet engagement
prediction (ch.~\ref{sec:prior_work}), before outlining limitations of this
research.
Afterwards, structure and aim of the developed models will be explained in general (ch.~\ref{sec:approach}).
Chapter~\ref{sec:data_collection} presents data used in this thesis.
The final subsection describes the infrastructure, i.e., software and hardware,
which was used to develop deep learning models.
