\chapter{Methodology}
\label{ch:methodology}

Having established necessary background knowledge in the previous chapter,
the experiments of this work can be introduced.
This chapter will first examine prior work in the area of tweet engagement
prediction (ch.~\ref{sec:prior_work}), before outlining limitations of this
research.
Afterwards, structure and aim of the developed models will be explained in general (ch.~\ref{sec:approach}).
The final section of this section describes the data sets used in this work,
as well as the collection process (ch.~\ref{sec:data_collection}).
