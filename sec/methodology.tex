\section{Methodology}
\label{ch:methodology}

Having established necessary background knowledge in the previous chapter,
experiments undertaken in this thesis can now be introduced.
This chapter will first examine prior work in the area of tweet engagement
prediction (ch.~\ref{sec:prior_work}), before outlining limitations of this
research.
Afterwards, structure and aim of the developed models will be explained (ch.~\ref{sec:approach}).
Chapter~\ref{sec:data_collection} presents data sets used in the context of this thesis.
The final subsection describes the infrastructure, i.e., software and hardware,
which was used to develop all models for this work.
