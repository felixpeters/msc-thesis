\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

This chapter will outline results of experiments conducted for this thesis,
according to the methodology outlined in the previous chapter.
Firstly, Chapter~\ref{sec:dda} delivers explorative analysis of all three
collected data sets, comparing them along several dimensions.
Afterwards, the developed models will be introduced along with an evaluation
of their predictive performance.
Included features, model architectures, necessary preprocessing steps and results will
be described for linear baseline (ch.~\ref{sec:linear_models}),
deep feedforward (ch.~\ref{sec:deep1}) and more complex deep models
(ch.~\ref{sec:deep_combined}).
