\subsection{Multi-Input Deep Neural Networks}
\label{sec:deep_combined}

This section aims to examine whether using the actual tweet content as an
auxiliary input has a positive influence on model performance.
Models created in this chapter make use of both structured and unstructured data,
effectively creating so-called \textit{multi-input} neural networks.
As a result, some of the more complex layer architectures introduced in Chapter~\ref{sub:dl_developments}
have to be applied in order to make sense of unstructured inputs.
How tweet texts can be incorporated in neural networks is described in the
first section (ch.~\ref{sub:text_preprocessing}).
Following the structure of previous chapters, model architecture (ch.~\ref{sub:comb_model_architecture}),
training process {ch.~\ref{comb_training_process}} and performance (ch.~\ref{sub:comb_performance})
are presented afterwards.
